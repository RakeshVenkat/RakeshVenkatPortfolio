# Welcome to my github projects

## 1. Website with native web-elments
I built a website for a food delivery service called **Omnifood**.

**_Technologies used_**:  
- Native web elements: `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`.
- Standard CSS Transitions are used for the hover effects.
- Used SVG icons and customized them using CSS styles.
- Utilized high quality images and appropriate content for a professional look.

## 2. Redux-Thunk examples
I created two example API integration usecases for demonstrating the usage of Redux thunk middleware in a React application. This can now be used as a boilerplate for making any API calls using Redux Thunk.
1. Real time weather data is obtained via [OpenWeather API](http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather)
2. Random images from [UnSplash API](https://api.unsplash.com/)

**_Technologies used_**:  
- The application is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) 
- `axios` is being used for making the API calls.
- `redux-thunk` as middleware.
